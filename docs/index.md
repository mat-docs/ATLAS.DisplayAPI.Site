# Custom Telemetry Visualization for Engineering Projects

**[McLaren ATLAS](https://www.mclaren.com/applied/catalogue/item/atlas/)** is a vital tool for engineering projects with demanding telemetry requirements.

ATLAS is ubiquitous in Formula One, and widely used across other motorsport and in automotive industry.

Engineers use ATLAS for development, simulation and monitoring for a diverse range of mission-critical systems.

ATLAS ships with a range of standard displays such as: Waveform, Scatterplot and Numeric to name a few.

In addition to standard displays, ATLAS is fully customizable, allowing custom displays to be added via plugins created using the Display API.

Using the Display API, custom displays can be made to look, behave and act just like the standard displays with full access to session and parameter data for custom visualizations tailored to specific third party needs.
