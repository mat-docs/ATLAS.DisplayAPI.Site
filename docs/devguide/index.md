The Display API is used by third parties to create custom display visualizations.

Custom displays are written in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) using [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/designers/getting-started-with-wpf) with [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel).

The Display API is published as a [NuGet](https://github.com/mat-docs/packages) package on GitHub.
